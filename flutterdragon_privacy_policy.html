        <span class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 17, 2026</span>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how FlutterDragon ("we," "us," or "our") collects,

        <h3>1.3 Location Information</h3>
        <p>

          collected if you grant permission and is used solely for app functionality.
